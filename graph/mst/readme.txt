V represents the number of nodes (vertices) in the graph. The nodes are numbered from 0 to V-1.
E represents the number of edges in the graph.

The following M lines describe the edges of the graph. Each line consists of 3 integers a, b, and c, each separated by a space.
A and B represent the two endpoints of the edge. C represents the weight of the edge.
