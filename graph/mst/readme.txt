The file 'graph.txt' represents a graph in textual form.

The first line contains two integers N and M, separated by a space.
N represents the number of nodes in the graph. The nodes are numbers from 0 to N-1.
M represents the number of edges in the graph.

The following M lines describe the edges of the graph. Each line consists of 3 integers A, B, and C, each separated by a space.
A and B represent the two endpoints of the edge. C represents the weight of the edge.
